### Requirements

Requirements will be documented as features in GitHub issues. 
Each requirement itself can be very high level, but it must be split up into concrete features.

### Implementation & Testing

We will use a kind of agile process, where we iterate through phases.
- Requirements Analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing
- Maintenance

After gathering requirements, these testable features will be disected into split into single ideas that relate to what each element can do in the form of user-stories.
User stories will then be posted as issues in our github repository.
Issues will be split into each branch which will allow individual features to be developed without interfering with other members works.
After a feature is complete the feature will be pushed and reviewed by team members before being commited to the master branch.

### Workflow Procedure

To successfully implement a feature in this repo, use the following steps:

1. Find an issue you want to work on in the Issues section and assign it to yourself.
2. On your local repo, make sure you run `git pull origin master`. This ensures that your master branch is up to date with the remote and, more importantly, that you have a working copy of the application. **It is important that the master branch is always a properly functioning branch**
3. Once you've updated your local master branch, use `git checkout -b issue-XX` (where XX is the number of the issue) to generate and switch to a new branch for your issue.
4. While working on your issue branch, get assistance from project leads and push your commits to the remote frequently with `git push origin issue-XX`. This enables other team members to collaborate on your branch.
5. When your branch is ready to be merged to master: push your branch to the remote, submit a pull request, and notify team members to review your changes. If there are merge conflicts, meet with a project leader to resolve them.
6. With no conflicts, merge the branch to master and delete the old issue.
